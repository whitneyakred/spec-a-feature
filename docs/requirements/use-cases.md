# **Introduction**

## **Purpose**

This document is the behavioral specification of Project Pulse — every user-initiated workflow it supports, written as a use case in the Wiegers & Beatty template (the field-by-field guidance follows below). Each use case carries a stable `UC-<AREA>-<slug>` identifier — a short area code (e.g., `SEC`, `WAR`, `DOC`, `AI`) plus a kebab-case name-based slug coined from the use case's name, unique within its area. Identifiers are stable handles, never renumbered; the area grouping is organizational only and does not affect a use case's identity. **A use case is itself a high-level functional requirement:** its "The system…" steps plus its Associated Information are its detailed functional specification, so the Software Requirements Specification does not restate use-case flows as separate functional requirements.

## **Scope**

This catalog covers Project Pulse end to end — the shared foundation (course sections, teams, students, instructors, accounts, rubrics), the performance-tracking workflows (weekly activity reports, peer evaluations), and the Requirements Authoring & Management (RAM) areas (templates and provisioning, glossary, documents, artifacts, links, validation, collaboration, review and submission, export, AI configuration, and AI assistants). Other docs cite use cases by identifier rather than restate their flows: the [Software Requirements Specification](software-requirements-specification.md) lists each `UC-<AREA>-<slug>` in its Use Cases section as a high-level functional requirement, [traceability.md](../traceability.md) carries one row per use case mapping it to the non-use-case `FR-<AREA>-<slug>`s it honors, the area design doc that realizes it, and the code modules and tests that implement it, and per-area design docs cite the use cases they design. In the other direction, this document cites business rules ([business-rules.md](business-rules.md), `BR-<slug>`) in each use case's Business Rules field and uses defined terms from [project-glossary.md](project-glossary.md) verbatim.

# **Use Case Template**

The headings below describe each field of the use-case template (Wiegers & Beatty). The use cases themselves begin in the [Use Case List](#use-case-list) section.

***Use Case ID and Name***
*Give each use case a unique integer sequence number identifier. State a concise name for the use case that indicates the value the use case would provide to some user. Begin with an action verb, followed by an object.*

***Author and Date Created***
*Enter the name of the person who initially wrote this use case and the date it was written.*

***Primary and Secondary Actors***
*An actor is a person or other entity external to the software system being specified who interacts with the system and performs use cases to accomplish tasks. Different actors often correspond to different user classes, or roles, identified from the customer community that will use the product. Name the primary actor that will be initiating this use case and any other secondary actors who will participate in completing execution of the use case.*

***Trigger***
*Identify the business event, system event, or user action that initiates the use case. This trigger alerts the system that it should begin testing the preconditions for the use case so it can judge whether to proceed with execution.*

***Description***
*Provide a brief description of the reason for and outcome of this use case, or a high-level description of the sequence of actions and the outcome of executing the use case.*

***Preconditions***
*List any activities that must take place, or any conditions that must be true, before the use case can be started. The system must be able to test each precondition. Number each precondition. Example: PRE-1: User's identity has been authenticated.*

***Postconditions***
*Describe the state of the system at the successful conclusion of the use case execution. Label each postcondition in the form POST-X, where X is a sequence number. Example: POST-1: Price of item in the database has been updated with the new value.*

***Main Success Scenario/Normal Flow***
*Provide a description of the user actions and corresponding system responses that will take place during execution of the use case under normal, expected conditions. This dialog sequence will ultimately lead to accomplishing the goal stated in the use case name and description. Show a numbered list of actions performed by the actor, alternating with responses provided by the system. The normal flow is numbered "X.0", where "X" is the use case ID.*

***Extensions:***

- ***Alternative Flows***
  *Document other successful usage scenarios that can take place within this use case. State the alternative flow, and describe any differences in the sequence of steps that take place. Number each alternative flow in the form "X.Y", where "X" is the use case ID and Y is a sequence number for the alternative flow. For example, "5.3" would indicate the third alternative flow for use case number 5. Indicate where each alternative flow would branch off from the normal flow, and if pertinent, where it would rejoin the normal flow.*

- ***Exceptions***
  *Describe any anticipated error conditions that could occur during execution of the use case and how the system is to respond to those conditions. Number each alternative flow in the form "X.Y.EZ", where "X" is the use case ID, Y indicates the normal (0) or alternative (>0) flow during which this exception could take place, "E" indicates an exception, and "Z" is a sequence number for the exceptions. For example "5.0.E2" would indicate the second exception for the normal flow for use case number 5. Indicate where in the normal (or an alternative) flow each exception could occur.*

***Priority***
*Indicate the relative priority of implementing the functionality required to allow this use case to be executed. Use the same priority scheme as that used for the functional requirements.*

***Frequency of Use***
*Estimate the number of times this use case will be performed per some appropriate unit of time. This gives an early indicator of throughput, concurrent usage loads, and transaction capacity.*

***Business Rules***
*List any business rules that influence this use case. Don't include the business rule text here, just its identifier so the reader can find it in another repository when needed.*

***Associated Information***
*Identify any additional requirements, such as quality attributes, for the use case that may need to be addressed during design or implementation. Also list any associated functional requirements that aren't a direct part of the use case flows but which a developer needs to know about. Describe what should happen if the use case execution fails for some unanticipated or systemic reason (e.g., loss of network connectivity, timeout). If the use case results in a durable state change in a database or the outside world, state whether the change is rolled back, completed correctly, partially completed with a known state, or left in an undetermined state as a result of the exception.*

***Assumptions***
*List any assumptions that were made regarding this use case or how it might execute.*

# **Use Case List**

The catalog of use cases begins below, grouped by area. Each area is an unnumbered H2 sub-heading and each use case an H3 carrying an area-prefixed ID (`UC-<AREA>-<slug>`). The catalog spans both the foundation and performance-tracking areas — Rubric, Course Section, Team, Student, Instructor, Account, Weekly Activity Report, and Peer Evaluation — and the requirements-authoring areas that follow them (Templates and Provisioning, Glossary, Requirement Documents, Requirement Artifacts, Artifact Links and Tracing, Validation, Collaboration, Review and Submission, Export, AI Configuration, and AI Assistants).

The note below is **not** the catalog. It records scope context only: a few Project Pulse capabilities not yet specified as use cases, and work that is **deferred or on hold**. Anything that has been specified appears as a `UC-<AREA>-<slug>` below — not in this note.

  - 10a3. Use case ends.
- **10b. One or more of the addresses already has an account:**
  - 10b1. The system creates no invitation for that address and sends it no email, since a registration link cannot be used by someone who has already registered.
  - 10b2. The system reports those addresses to the course admin alongside the ones it invited, so that re-inviting a whole roster reports where the course section stands.
  - 10b3. Use case ends.

### **UC-STU-view-pending-invitations: The course admin views the students who have not registered yet**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-STU-view-pending-invitations: View the students who have not registered yet
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** course admin
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The course admin indicates to view the outstanding student invitations of a course section.
**Description:** The course admin wants to see which invited students have not created an account yet, so that she can follow up with those students instead of re-inviting the whole course section.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The course admin is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The course admin owns the course section (BR-invitations-admin-only).

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The course admin is shown the invited students who have not registered.
- POST-2. The course admin is shown how many such students there are.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The course admin indicates to view the outstanding student invitations of a course section.
2. The system displays every address invited to that course section as a student that has not registered an account.
3. The system displays how many such addresses there are.
4. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **2a. Every invited student has registered:**
  - 2a1. The system informs the course admin that no student invitation is outstanding.
  - 2a2. Use case ends.

**Priority:** Medium
**Frequency of Use:** 1 user, a few usages per course section per semester.
**Business Rules:** BR-invitations-admin-only

**Associated Information:**
- The listing shows email addresses only. An invitation also carries the registration token that its email delivers, and that token is never included in a listing.
- Registering deletes the invitation that was used, so a student leaves this listing by signing up, and no invitation is created for an address that already has an account (UC-STU-invite-students, extension 10b), so re-inviting a whole course section adds nobody to this listing who has already joined.
- Instructor invitations (UC-INS-invite-instructors) are not shown here; this listing is about students joining a course section.

**Assumptions:** AS-one-section-per-student (an invitation is keyed by the invited address alone, which is unambiguous only because a student is invited to one course section)

### **UC-STU-remind-non-submitters: The course admin/instructor reminds students who have not submitted**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-STU-remind-non-submitters: Remind students who have not submitted **Created By:** Whitney **Date Created:** 10/01/2026 **Primary Actor:** course admin, instructor **Secondary Actors:** student **Trigger:** The user indicates to view the students who have not submitted for the current week. **Description:** The user wants to see which students have not submitted their weekly activity report or peer evaluation for the current week, so that she knows who is falling behind, and the course admin can remind only those students instead of the whole course section.

**Preconditions:**

- PRE-1. The user is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The user is the course admin or an instructor of the course section (BR-section-scoped-access).

**Postconditions:**

- POST-1. The user is shown the non-submitters for the current week, separately for each artifact, and a separate note of students not assigned to a team.
- POST-2. If the course admin chose to send, each selected student who is still a non-submitter has been emailed a reminder naming only her own missing artifacts, and the course admin has been told which students were skipped or could not be emailed.

**Main Success Scenario:**

1. The user indicates to view the students who have not submitted for a course section.
2. The system determines the current week of the course section.
3. The system displays, separately for the weekly activity report and the peer evaluation, the students who have not submitted that artifact, according to the "Non-submitter definition" in the Associated Information of this use case.
4. The system displays, in a separate note, the students in the course section who are not assigned to a team.
5. The course admin selects which of the listed students to remind.
6. The system displays the reminder email and asks the course admin to confirm sending it.
7. The course admin confirms.
8. The system checks again whether each selected student is still a non-submitter, and sends a reminder to each one who is, naming only the artifacts she is missing.
9. The system informs the course admin how many reminders were sent.
10. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

- **2a. The current week is not an active week:**
  * 2a1. The system does not list weekly activity report non-submitters.
  * 2a2. If the previous week was active, the system still lists peer evaluation non-submitters (BR-active-weeks, BR-evaluation-submission-window); otherwise it informs the user that nothing is due this week and the use case ends.
- **3a. Every student has submitted both artifacts:**
  * 3a1. The system informs the user that no student is missing a submission this week.
  * 3a2. The system still displays the note of students not assigned to a team, if any, and the use case ends.
- **4a. The user is an instructor, not the course admin:**
  * 4a1. The system does not offer to send reminders (BR-reminders-admin-only).
  * 4a2. Use case ends.
- **5a. The submission window for an artifact has closed:**
  * 5a1. Because the user views only the current week, during which both artifacts remain submittable (BR-evaluation-submission-window, AS-war-submittable-all-week), this should not arise; if a window rule changes so that it does, the system still lists the students who did not submit but does not offer reminders for that artifact (BR-reminder-while-open).
- **8a. A selected student has already been sent a reminder for that artifact today (BR-reminder-limit):**
  * 8a1. The system does not send her another reminder for that artifact.
  * 8a2. The system tells the course admin which students were skipped for this reason.
  * 8a3. The system continues with the remaining selected students.
- **8b. A selected student has submitted since the list was displayed:**
  * 8b1. The system does not send her a reminder for that artifact.
  * 8b2. The system tells the course admin which students were skipped for this reason.
- **8c. The system cannot email one or more selected students:**
  * 8c1. The system continues with the remaining students, so one undeliverable address does not cost the others their reminder.
  * 8c2. The system tells the course admin which students could not be emailed.

**Priority:** Medium **Frequency of Use:** Course admin and instructors, a few times per active week. **Business Rules:** BR-section-scoped-access, BR-role-based-access, BR-team-assignment-required, BR-student-lifecycle, BR-active-weeks, BR-evaluation-submission-window, BR-reminders-admin-only, BR-reminder-limit, BR-reminder-while-open

**Associated Information:**

- Non-submitter definition: judged separately for each artifact. A student is a non-submitter if she is active, assigned to a team, and, at the moment the system checks, has no submission of (a) her weekly activity report for the current week, or (b) her peer evaluation of the previous week, due during the current week. A student who has evaluated some but not all of her current teammates has not submitted her peer evaluation. A submission that was deleted does not count. Students who cannot submit (unassigned or deactivated) are never non-submitters.
- Privacy: submission status is a student record (CO-ferpa). The list is shown only to users permitted by BR-section-scoped-access. Each reminder is sent to one student individually and names only her own missing artifacts, never another student.
- Instructors see the same list as the course admin, but only for course sections they are assigned to.

**Related Use Cases:** UC-STU-view-pending-invitations; UC-EVA-submit-evaluation; UC-SEC-setup-active-weeks. The scheduled weekly reminder skipping students who have already submitted is a separate use case, not written here. **Assumptions:** AS-war-submittable-all-week: no business rule sets a deadline for a weekly activity report, so this use case assumes a student can submit her current week's report at any time during that week. **Open Issues:**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-STU-delete-student: Delete a student
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** course admin
**Secondary Actors:** student
**Trigger:** The course admin indicates to delete a student.
**Description:** The course admin wants to delete a student, because a student may drop out of the course section.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The course admin is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. There exists at least one student in the system.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The student is deleted from the system according to the "Deletion strategy" defined in the Associated Information of this use case.

2. The course admin views the details of this student through UC-STU-view-student: View a student.
3. The course admin chooses to delete this student.
4. The system alerts the course admin of the consequences of this deletion according to the "Data integrity and deletion rules" defined in the Associated Information of this use case, warns the course admin about the deletion, and asks the course admin to confirm.
5. The course admin confirms the deletion.
6. The system deletes the student according to the "Deletion strategy" defined in the Associated Information of this use case and alerts the course admin that this student has been deleted.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

**Frequency of Use:** Rare. 1 user, 1 usage per year.
**Business Rules:** BR-student-lifecycle

**Associated Information:**
- Data integrity and deletion rules: If a student already submits WARs and peer evaluations,  deleting a student will automatically delete the associated WARs and peer evaluations. Deletion strategy: student deletion is a physical delete. In other words, this will permanently remove the student and the associated WARs and peer evaluations from the database (cannot be recovered).

### **UC-STU-deactivate-student: The course admin/instructor deactivates a student**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-STU-deactivate-student: Deactivate a student
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** course admin / instructor
**Secondary Actors:** student
**Trigger:** The course admin or instructor indicates to deactivate a student.
**Description:** The course admin or instructor wants to deactivate a student — for example, when a student withdraws from the course section — so that the student no longer has access to the system while her submitted work is retained.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The course admin or instructor is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. There exists at least one active student in the system.

**Postconditions:**

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Approximately 2 users, average of 1 usage per week.
**Business Rules:** BR-section-scoped-access (the instructor may generate the report only for a course section she is assigned to), BR-evaluation-private-comment

**Associated Information:**

Report generating parameters:
- Active week: Each peer evaluation report is associated with a week. The instructor shall first indicate for which active week she wants to generate a peer evaluation. E.g., "02-12-2024 to 02-18-2024"; by default, it shall be the previous week.
- Columns to include: student name, grade, comments. See the example below.
- Sorting criteria: by default, sort by last name in ascending order.
- Pagination: Not needed.
- Format of the generated report: HTML.

An example of the generated report:

| student | Grade | Commented by | Public comments | Private comments |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| John Doe | 54/60 | Tim Smith | Good work. | Nothing. |
|  |  | Lily Fisher | Need to work harder. | Dr. Wei, I need to talk more about John. |
| Lily Fisher | … | … | … | … |

The report shall show who did not turn in the peer evaluation for that week.

Report generating algorithm: How to compute the peer evaluation grade for a student? Each student receives multiple peer evaluations from her teammates every week. First, obtain the peer evaluations received by a student for that week. For each peer evaluation, compute a total score by adding up the individual criterion scores. Then compute the average of the total scores across the peer evaluations. For example, John Doe receives two peer evaluations from Tim Smith and Lily Fisher, respectively. Tim Smith gives the following scores based on the rubric: 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10. So the total score given by Tim is 58. Lily Fisher gives the following scores based on the rubric: 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10. So the total score given by Tim is 50. The grade that John Doe receives that week is (58 + 50) / 2 = 54.

Details of a peer evaluation: The instructor may choose to see more details of one student's peer evaluation. For example, this table below shows the scores given by each evaluator in the same team to John Doe.

| Evaluator of John Doe | Quality of work — How do you rate the quality of this teammate's work? (1-10) | … | Public comments | Private comments |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| John Doe | 10 | … | … | … |
| Lily Fisher | 6 | … | … | … |
| Tim Smith | 9 | … | … | … |

5. The system makes the created documents available to the team.
6. The system informs the course admin that the team's documents have been created.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **3a. One or more documents already exist for the team**
  - 3a1. The system informs the course admin that the team already has requirement documents of those types; an existing document cannot be regenerated or overwritten, so only the missing document types can be created.
  - 3a2. The course admin either creates only the missing documents (the types not yet created) or terminates the use case.
- **4a. No built-in templates are configured for the team**
  - 4a1. The system alerts the course admin that no templates are available for the team and that no documents can be created.
  - 4a2. The course admin terminates the use case.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Once per team, at team setup; rarely repeated.
**Business Rules:** BR-document-creation — Only a course admin may create a team's requirement documents, and each document type is created at most once per team (an existing document cannot be regenerated or overwritten).
**Associated Information:**

Details:
- The set of documents created is determined by the built-in templates configured for the team (e.g., the Project Glossary, Use Cases, Business Rules, and section-based requirement documents such as Vision and Scope and SRS).
- The document sections of each document are instantiated from its template; documents and document sections are created empty, ready for authoring.
- MVP: built-in templates are fixed (hardcoded); template customization is out of scope.

### **UC-ART-create-artifact: The student creates a requirement artifact**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-ART-create-artifact: Create a requirement artifact
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The student, while viewing a list-type document section, indicates to add a requirement artifact to it.
**Description:** The student wants to create a new requirement artifact (for example, a business objective, risk, or feature) and add it to the requirements graph. In the MVP she does this from within the document section that holds artifacts of that kind — she navigates to the section (e.g., business objectives) and adds the artifact there, so the section determines both the artifact's placement and its artifact type.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the requirement document.
- PRE-3. The document is not locked for review.
- PRE-4. The student is viewing the list-type document section to which the artifact will belong.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The new requirement artifact is stored in the system.
- POST-2. The artifact appears in the requirements graph.
- POST-3. The artifact appears in the document section it was created in (and in any other document view its type maps to).
- POST-4. The system records authorship metadata (e.g., last-modified timestamp and editor identity).

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student, viewing a list-type document section, indicates to add a requirement artifact to it.
2. The system asks the student to enter the details of the new artifact according to the "Details" defined in the Associated Information of this use case; because the document section determines the artifact's type, the student enters its content, metadata, and notes rather than choosing a type.
3. The student enters the details of this new requirement artifact and confirms that she has finished.
4. The system validates the student's inputs according to the "Details" defined in the Associated Information of this use case.
5. The system checks whether an artifact of the same type with similar content already exists, according to the "Duplication detection rules" defined in the Associated Information of this use case.
6. The system displays the details of the new requirement artifact and asks the student to confirm the creation.
7. The student either confirms the creation (continues the normal flow) or chooses to modify the details (returns to step 3).
8. The system saves the new requirement artifact, adds it to the requirements graph, and informs the student that this requirement artifact has been created.
9. The system places the new artifact in the document section it was created in (and in any other document view its type maps to).
10. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **4a. Input validation rule violation**
  - 4a1. The system alerts the student that an input validation rule is violated and displays the nature and location of the error.
  - 4a2. The student corrects the mistake and returns to step 4 of the normal flow.
- **5a. The system finds a possible duplicate (an existing artifact of the same type with similar content)**
  - 5a1. The system warns the student and shows the possible duplicate(s).
  - 5a2. The student may open the existing artifact instead of creating a new one, revise her input and return to step 4, or proceed with the creation if the new artifact is genuinely distinct (continue at step 6). The warning is advisory and does not block creation.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Varies by team and project phase; most frequent during active authoring and near deadlines.
**Business Rules:** BR-team-scoped-access, BR-role-based-access (team-scoped access control); BR-artifact-key-unique (unique, stable artifact key). The document section the artifact is created in determines its placement and its artifact type.
**Associated Information:**

Details:

| Property name | Data type | Editability | Validation rule | Effect of change | Reference to glossary |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Requirement artifact type |  |  |  |  |  |
| Content |  |  |  |  |  |
| Links |  |  |  |  |  |
| Metadata: priority, status |  |  |  |  |  |
| Notes |  |  |  |  |  |

*Column "Effect of change" shows consequences of modification other than saving.*

The artifact's type is set by the document section it is created in; the student does not choose it in the MVP.

Placement:
- MVP: the artifact is created in the document section the student is currently viewing; that section determines its placement and artifact type.
- Future (requirements graph view): when the student adds an artifact directly in the graph — which shows all artifacts independent of document sections — there is no section context, so she selects the destination section, or the system places it by artifact type (the artifact type → authoring-home map in the SRS's [Business Domain Model](software-requirements-specification.md#business-domain-model)).

Duplication detection rules: Advisory only — the system warns when an artifact of the same type has similar content (fuzzy match) but does not block creation; the student decides whether to proceed, revise, or open the existing artifact.

Notification: None — routine authoring changes are not notified (FR-NOT-suppress-routine); saved changes propagate to connected teammates in real time (UC-COL-collaborative-edit).

The student shall be able to cancel the use case at any time prior to submitting it.

**Related Use Cases:** The student may first choose to UC-ART-find-artifacts: Find requirement artifacts but cannot find any, then decide to create one.

### **UC-ART-promote-selection: The student creates a requirement artifact from document content (promote selection)**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-ART-promote-selection: Create a requirement artifact from document content (promote selection)
**Status:** Tabled — future release

The student selects text within a requirement document and promotes it to a structured requirement artifact of a chosen type, enabling traceability, navigation, and consistent reuse across documents.

For the MVP, the "Promote Selection to requirement artifact" use case is tabled.

Reason:
Core requirement artifacts (e.g., business objectives, risks, features, functional requirements) are created explicitly through structured Create \<Artifact Type\> actions, not written as free text. Since students do not author these elements in unstructured prose, promotion provides limited value in the MVP.

Note:
This use case may be revisited in future versions if free-text authoring or refactoring workflows are introduced.

6. The student confirms the deletion.
7. The system deletes the requirement artifact according to the "Deletion strategy" and the "Referring objects handling strategy" defined in the Associated Information of this use case and alerts the student that this requirement artifact has been deleted.
8. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **4a. Data integrity and deletion rule violation**
  - 4a1. The system alerts the student that a deletion rule is violated and displays the nature of the violation.
  - 4a2. The system prompts possible actions to resolve the violation.
  - 4a3. use case terminates.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Varies by team and project phase; most frequent during active authoring and near deadlines.
**Business Rules:** BR-team-scoped-access, BR-role-based-access (team-scoped access control); BR-deletion-integrity (a referenced artifact cannot be deleted; deletion is logical).
**Associated Information:**

Deletion strategy:
- Logical delete: The requirement artifact is marked as deleted and removed from active use.
- Deleted requirement artifacts are not visible to students and cannot be reused.
- Only privileged administrative users may view deleted requirement artifacts for audit purposes.

Referring objects handling strategy:
- Deletion is blocked if the requirement artifact is referenced by any requirement artifact.

## **Artifact Links and Tracing**

### **UC-LNK-view-links: The student views requirement artifact links**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-LNK-view-links: View requirement artifact links
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The student indicates to view the artifact links of a requirement artifact.
**Description:** The student wants to view all the relationships of a requirement artifact so that she can better understand its upstream and downstream links.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the requirement artifact.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The artifact's relationships are displayed to the student.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to view the links of a requirement artifact.
2. The student finds a list of requirement artifacts through UC-ART-find-artifacts: Find requirement artifacts.
3. The student views the list and chooses to view the links of one specific requirement artifact.
4. The system retrieves and displays the links of this requirement artifact according to the "Details" defined in the Associated Information and the "Security/access concerns" defined in the business rules of this use case.
5. The student views the links.
6. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **5a. The student expands a displayed artifact to see its further links**
  - 5a1. The student selects a related artifact shown in step 4 and chooses to expand it.
  - 5a2. The system retrieves and displays that artifact's links one additional hop out (lazy expansion), grouped by relationship type and with directionality indicated as in step 4, and returns to step 5.
  - 5a3. The system does not re-expand an artifact already shown in the current view, so traversal stays finite even when the graph contains cycles; the student may keep expanding to any depth. For an ordered, end-to-end path along abstraction levels (rather than free exploration), the student uses UC-LNK-trace-requirement: Trace a requirement across levels.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Varies by team and project phase; most frequent during active authoring and near deadlines.
**Business Rules:** BR-team-scoped-access, BR-role-based-access (team-scoped access control).
**Associated Information:**
- Each link shall include the relationship type and the related requirement artifact.
- The system shall group upstream and downstream artifacts by relationship type.
- Relationships may be shown in list or simple graph form in the MVP.
- Directionality (upstream vs downstream) must be clearly indicated.
- The default view shows one hop (the artifact's immediate links). The student may expand any displayed artifact one hop at a time and may keep expanding to any depth — it is a graph, so multi-hop traversal is not artificially capped. The system loads each hop on demand (lazy expansion) rather than eagerly loading the whole graph, keeping the view responsive as it grows.
- An artifact already shown is not expanded again within the same view, so cycles do not cause loops or duplicate nodes and the displayed set stays finite.

**UC ID and Name:** UC-LNK-delete-link: Delete a requirement artifact link
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The student indicates to delete an existing link.
**Description:** The student wants to delete an existing link so that a relationship that no longer holds is removed from the requirements graph.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns both requirement artifacts.
- PRE-3. The requirement artifacts are not locked for review.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The link is permanently deleted from the system; both endpoint artifacts remain unchanged.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to delete an existing link.
2. The student views the details of this link through UC-LNK-view-link: View a requirement artifact link.
3. The student chooses to delete this link.
4. The system warns the student that the link will be permanently removed and asks her to confirm.

**Frequency of Use:** Varies by team and project phase; most frequent during active authoring and near deadlines.
**Business Rules:** BR-team-scoped-access, BR-role-based-access (team-scoped access control).
**Associated Information:**

Deletion strategy:
- Hard delete: the link (a graph edge) is permanently removed. The two endpoint requirement artifacts are unaffected, and no other artifact references a link, so there are no referring objects to reconcile.

Notification: None — routine authoring changes are not notified (FR-NOT-suppress-routine); saved changes propagate to connected teammates in real time (UC-COL-collaborative-edit).

### **UC-LNK-trace-requirement: The student traces a requirement across levels**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-LNK-trace-requirement: Trace a requirement across levels
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The student indicates to trace a requirement across multiple abstraction levels.
**Description:** The student wants to trace a requirement from a high-level objective through intermediate artifacts (such as features and use cases) down to functional requirements so that she can understand requirement coverage, rationale, and completeness.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the requirement artifact.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The traced requirement path is displayed to the student.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to trace a requirement across multiple abstraction levels.
2. The student finds a list of high-level requirement artifacts through UC-ART-find-artifacts: Find requirement artifacts, e.g., business objectives.
3. The student views the list and chooses to trace one specific requirement artifact.
4. The system retrieves downstream artifacts linked to the selected artifact (e.g., Features).
5. The system displays the next-level artifacts in the trace path.
6. The student selects one of the displayed artifacts to continue tracing.
7. The system retrieves and displays the next-level artifacts (e.g., use cases).
8. The student continues navigation until reaching functional requirements.
9. The system displays the completed trace path (Objective → Feature → use case → functional requirement).
10. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **2a. Start trace from a lower-level requirement artifact**
  - 2a1. The system retrieves and displays upstream artifacts.
  - 2a2. The trace proceeds in reverse order.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Varies by team and project phase; most frequent during active authoring and near deadlines.
**Business Rules:** BR-team-scoped-access, BR-role-based-access (team-scoped access control).
**Associated Information:**
- The system shall display all available trace paths if multiple trace paths exist.
- Trace paths may be displayed as an ordered list or simple graph.
- Tracing is lazy and incremental: the system loads each next level on demand as the student advances (steps 4–8) rather than precomputing the full graph, and it does not re-expand an artifact already on the current path, so cycles terminate. The trace spans as many levels as the path requires (e.g., Objective → Feature → use case → functional requirement).

**Related Use Cases:** UC-LNK-view-links: View requirement artifact links — free, any-direction, any-depth exploration of an artifact's links. This use case instead follows an ordered, goal-driven path along abstraction levels (e.g., Objective → Feature → use case → functional requirement). Difference: UC-LNK-view-links is free exploration; UC-LNK-trace-requirement is an ordered end-to-end path.

## **Validation**

### **UC-VAL-run-validation: The student runs validation (ReqLint) on the current document**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-VAL-run-validation: Run validation on a requirement document
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The student indicates to run ReqLint validation on the currently selected requirement document.
**Description:** The student wants to run ReqLint on a single requirement document to detect structural issues, missing required content, naming violations, and other deterministic rule violations. The system reports validation results as errors and warnings tied to specific document sections or items.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the requirement document.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. Validation results for the selected document are generated and displayed.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to run ReqLint validation on the currently selected requirement document.
2. The system runs document-level ReqLint checks (e.g., required document sections completed, formatting rules).
3. The system generates a list of validation issues with severity (ERROR/WARNING/INFO).
4. The system displays validation issues grouped by document section and rule category.
5. The student selects an issue to view details.
6. The system navigates the student to the relevant document section/item and highlights the location.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **2a. ReqLint validation cannot be completed**
  - 2a1. The system is unable to finish the validation run (for example, a processing error in the ReqLint engine).
  - 2a2. The system informs the student that validation did not complete and that no results are available, and invites the student to run it again; the student returns to step 1.
- **3a. The document has no validation issues**
  - 3a1. The document-level ReqLint checks produce no errors, warnings, or info findings.
  - 3a2. The system reports that the document passed validation and displays an empty issue list — a clean result is a successful outcome, distinct from validation never having been run. Use case ends.
- **6a. The student corrects an issue and re-runs validation**
  - 6a1. From the highlighted location, the student edits the affected document section or use case to resolve the finding (UC-DOC-edit-document: Edit a document section, or UC-DOC-edit-use-case: Edit a use case).
  - 6a2. The student re-runs ReqLint and returns to step 1; the system regenerates the issue list, which reflects the correction.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Varies by team and project phase; most frequent during active authoring and near deadlines.
**Business Rules:**
**Associated Information:**

The ReqLint engine applies the applicable deterministic validation rules to the document and returns a structured list of issues, each classified by severity (ERROR, WARNING, INFO) and tied to the document section or item it concerns. The same checks are re-run automatically during authoring by the background re-evaluation (FR-VAL-background-recheck).

Details (Examples of Document-Level Checks):
- Required document section missing or empty
- Required fields missing for a document section/item
- Ambiguous, unverifiable, or subjective wording, per instructor-defined rules and defaults
- Naming convention violations (e.g., missing artifact keys where required)
- Required "shall" structure for functional requirements (if applicable)
- use case step format rules (if applicable)

## **Collaboration**

### **UC-COL-collaborative-edit: The student collaboratively edits a requirement document**

*Post-MVP — this real-time collaborative-editing session is deferred beyond the initial release. In the MVP, teammates author the same document through per-section locking (UC-DOC-edit-document, UC-DOC-edit-use-case) and coordinate via comment threads (UC-COL-add-comment, UC-COL-resolve-comment).*

**UC ID and Name:** UC-COL-collaborative-edit: Collaboratively edit a requirement document
**Status:** Deferred — post-MVP
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Other students on the same team
**Trigger:** The student opens a requirement document that one or more teammates are also connected to.
**Description:** The student wants to author a requirement document at the same time as her teammates so that the team can work together in real time — seeing who else is present, watching each other's changes appear live, and being kept from overwriting one another's work. This use case covers the shared editing *session*; the act of editing an individual document section or use case is performed through UC-DOC-edit-document and UC-DOC-edit-use-case, which acquire and release the locks.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the requirement document.
- PRE-3. The document is not locked for review.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. All connected team members see a consistent, up-to-date view of the document.
- POST-2. No collaborator's saved changes are overwritten or corrupted by another collaborator.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student opens a requirement document through UC-DOC-view-document: View a section-based requirement document (or UC-DOC-view-use-cases-document: View the Use Cases document).
2. The system displays which teammates are currently connected to the document and which document sections or use cases are currently locked, and by whom.
3. The system notifies all connected team members that the student has joined the document.
4. The student edits a document section through UC-DOC-edit-document: Edit a section-based requirement document, or a use case through UC-DOC-edit-use-case: Edit a use case.
5. As the student acquires a lock and saves changes (within UC-DOC-edit-document / UC-DOC-edit-use-case), the system broadcasts the updated lock state and the saved content to all connected team members in real time.
6. The system reflects teammates' presence, lock changes, and saved changes in the student's view as they occur.
7. The student leaves the document.
8. The system notifies all connected team members that the student has disconnected.
9. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **4a. The student attempts to edit a document section or use case that is locked by a teammate**
  - 4a1. UC-DOC-edit-document / UC-DOC-edit-use-case handle this: the system does not grant the lock, and the student chooses a different target or waits.
- **6a. A teammate joins or disconnects during the session**
  - 6a1. The system updates the displayed presence and lock state for the student and returns to step 4 of the normal flow.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Very frequent: multiple times per student per working session; peaks near deadlines.
**Business Rules:** BR-edit-lock-required, BR-collab-no-overwrite — Editing and locking of individual document sections and use cases are governed by UC-DOC-edit-document and UC-DOC-edit-use-case. The system shall ensure that real-time updates do not overwrite or corrupt content saved by other collaborators.
**Associated Information:**

Presence and synchronization:
- The system shall notify connected users when a collaborator joins or disconnects.
- The system shall broadcast lock acquisition and release to all team members viewing the document.
- The system shall ensure that real-time updates do not overwrite or corrupt content saved by other collaborators.

**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** instructor
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The instructor indicates to view or edit the teaching context for a course section she teaches.
**Description:** The instructor wants to author and maintain the teaching context for a course section — the instructor-authored context that encodes the standards students are graded against (e.g., INVEST, testability, Wiegers categories), common student mistakes, and the thinking order to follow — so that the course section's AI assistants draw on a deliberately designed curriculum. The teaching context is a first-class, instructor-controlled teaching artifact.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The instructor is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The instructor is assigned to the course section.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The course section's teaching context is updated and stored.
- POST-2. The course section's assistants use the updated teaching context on subsequent requests.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The instructor indicates to view the teaching context for a course section she teaches.
2. The system displays the current teaching context for the course section.
3. The instructor edits the teaching context content (e.g., standards, common-mistake guidance, and thinking order). Per-assistant behavior is configured separately through UC-CFG-configure-assistant-instructions.
4. The system saves the updated teaching context and confirms.
5. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Occasional; at course setup and periodic refinement.
**Business Rules:** BR-section-config-access — Only an instructor assigned to the course section may view or edit its teaching context. The teaching context is the context the course section's assistants draw on.

### **UC-CFG-toggle-assistants: The instructor enables or disables AI assistants for a course section**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-CFG-toggle-assistants: Enable or disable AI assistants for a course section
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** instructor
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The instructor indicates to change which AI assistants are available for a course section she teaches.
**Description:** The instructor wants to enable or disable AI assistants — individually, per assistant — for the students in a course section she teaches, so that she controls whether and when each kind of AI help is permitted (for example, disabling the drafting assistant during a graded elicitation exercise while leaving the tutor assistant on). This setting governs the availability of the student-facing AI use cases (UC-AI-elicit-requirements, UC-AI-practice-interview, UC-AI-structure-notes, UC-AI-critique, UC-AI-tutor, UC-AI-draft-skeleton, UC-AI-consult-project-assistant, UC-AI-whole-project-review) for that course section's teams.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The instructor is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The instructor is assigned to the course section.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The per-assistant enable/disable settings for the course section are updated and stored.
- POST-2. The change takes effect for students in the course section on subsequent requests.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The instructor indicates to change the AI assistant settings for a course section she teaches.
2. The system displays each AI assistant and its current enabled/disabled state for the course section.
3. The instructor enables or disables one or more assistants.
4. The system saves the updated settings and applies them.
5. The system informs the instructor that the settings have been updated.
6. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

- **4a. A student is mid-session with an assistant that is being disabled**
  - 4a1. The system applies the change on the student's next assistant request and goes to step 5 of the normal flow.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Occasional; at course setup and around graded exercises.
**Business Rules:** BR-section-config-access, BR-assistant-enablement — Only an instructor assigned to the course section may change its AI assistant settings. Assistants may be enabled or disabled individually. When an assistant is disabled, its corresponding student-facing use case is unavailable for that course section's students. The drafting assistant (UC-AI-draft-skeleton) shall be disabled by default.

### **UC-CFG-configure-assistant-instructions: The instructor configures the assistant instructions for a course section**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-CFG-configure-assistant-instructions: Configure the assistant instructions for a course section
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** instructor
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The instructor indicates to view or edit the instructions for an AI assistant in a course section she teaches.
**Description:** The instructor wants to author and maintain the assistant instructions for each AI assistant in a course section she teaches — the per-assistant directives that govern how an assistant behaves: its role (what the assistant does), its persona and tone (for example, Socratic, patient, warm, like an experienced requirements engineer), and what it must avoid (for example, handing students finished requirements rather than eliciting their next draft). Whereas the teaching context (UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context) supplies the course-section-wide standards every assistant is held to, assistant instructions are configured per assistant so the instructor can shape each assistant's behavior independently. Assistant instructions are a first-class, instructor-controlled teaching artifact.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The instructor is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The instructor is assigned to the course section.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The selected assistant's assistant instructions for the course section are updated and stored.
- POST-2. The assistant uses the updated assistant instructions on subsequent requests.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The instructor indicates to view the assistant instructions for a course section she teaches.
2. The system displays the available AI assistants and the current assistant instructions for each.
3. The instructor selects an assistant and edits its assistant instructions (its role, its persona and tone, and the behavior it must avoid).
4. The system saves the updated assistant instructions and confirms.
5. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Occasional; at course setup and periodic refinement.
**Business Rules:** BR-section-config-access — Only an instructor assigned to the course section may view or edit its assistant instructions. Assistant instructions are authored per assistant and govern assistant behavior, while the teaching context governs the standards the assistant enforces.
**Associated Information:**
- Assistant instructions are the per-assistant behavioral layer; the teaching context (UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context) is the shared standards layer the instructions reference.
- Applies to every assistant in the course section.

### **UC-CFG-configure-review-criteria: The instructor configures the cross-document review criteria for a course section**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-CFG-configure-review-criteria: Configure the cross-document review criteria for a course section
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** instructor
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The instructor indicates to view or edit the cross-document review criteria used by the critique assistant for a course section she teaches.
**Description:** The instructor wants to author and maintain the cross-document review criteria for a course section she teaches — the criteria the critique assistant applies when a student requests a whole-project review (UC-AI-whole-project-review) of the team's entire set of requirement documents. The criteria define the dimensions and standards the whole-project review checks across documents (for example: every feature has a downstream use case and functional requirement; every cited glossary term, business rule, and FR resolves; scope statements agree across documents; no conflicts between documents). Whereas the teaching context (UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context) supplies the course-section-wide, per-requirement quality standards and assistant instructions (UC-CFG-configure-assistant-instructions) supply per-assistant behavior, the cross-document review criteria define what the whole-project review evaluates across the document set. They must be defined before the whole-project review is available to the course section's students. A course admin, who is also an instructor of her course, may perform this use case.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The instructor is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The instructor is assigned to the course section.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The course section's cross-document review criteria are updated and stored.
- POST-2. The critique assistant uses the updated criteria on subsequent whole-project reviews (UC-AI-whole-project-review).

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The instructor indicates to view the cross-document review criteria for a course section she teaches.
2. The system displays the current cross-document review criteria for the course section (or an indication that none are defined yet, optionally seeded from a system-provided default).
3. The instructor edits the criteria (the dimensions and standards the whole-project review checks across documents).
4. The system validates and saves the updated criteria and confirms.
5. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **4a. The criteria are empty or invalid**
  - 4a1. The system alerts the instructor that the criteria cannot be saved as entered and does not store them; the instructor corrects the input and returns to step 3.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Occasional; at course setup and periodic refinement.
**Business Rules:** BR-section-config-access — Only an instructor assigned to the course section (including a course admin of its course) may view or edit its cross-document review criteria.
**Associated Information:**
- The cross-document review criteria are a course-section-level teaching artifact, distinct from the teaching context (UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context) and per-assistant assistant instructions (UC-CFG-configure-assistant-instructions); they govern the critique assistant's whole-project review mode (UC-AI-whole-project-review) specifically.
- While the criteria are undefined for a course section, the whole-project review is unavailable to that course section's students (UC-AI-whole-project-review, PRE-4 and extension 1a).
- The system-provided default the criteria are seeded from (main flow step 2) is maintained in `docs/product/cross-document-review-criteria.md` (the default criteria set + the critique assistant's whole-project-review system prompt).
- The configured criteria are consumed by the critique assistant's whole-project review (UC-AI-whole-project-review), which includes them in its context and is unavailable until they are defined.

## **AI Assistants**

### **UC-AI-import-source-material: The student imports client pitch materials as project source**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-import-source-material: Import client pitch materials as project source
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:**
**Trigger:** The student indicates to import the client's pitch materials into the project.
**Description:** At project kickoff the client pitches the project with materials such as a slide deck and a short PDF covering background, stakeholders, problem statement, users, objectives, desired functionality, possible solutions, prototypes, and a candidate tech stack. The student imports these into RAM as project source material so that the team and the AI assistants can reference them while eliciting and authoring requirements. The materials are inputs the team works from — not authored requirement content.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the project.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The imported materials are stored as project source material for the team.
- POST-2. The materials' content is available to the team and, where AI assistants are enabled, as context for those assistants.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to import client pitch materials.
2. The system asks the student to provide the files (e.g., a slide deck and a PDF).
3. The student selects the files and confirms.
4. The system validates the files against the supported formats and size limits.
5. The system stores the files as project source material and extracts their text content so it can be referenced and supplied as context to the AI assistants.
6. The system confirms that the materials are available to the team.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **4a. A file is in an unsupported format or exceeds the size limit**
  - 4a1. The system informs the student which file was rejected and why, and the student provides a different file or terminates the use case.
- **5a. Text extraction is incomplete (e.g., an image-only or scanned PDF)**
  - 5a1. The system stores the materials, informs the student that automatic text extraction was incomplete, and notes that assistant context from those materials may be limited.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Once per project at kickoff; occasionally updated when the client provides revised materials.
**Business Rules:** BR-source-material-import — Only a member of the team that owns the project may import its project source material. Imported materials are project inputs, not authored requirement content, and are not themselves graded as requirements.
**Associated Information:**
- The elicitation assistant uses the imported materials for gap analysis and interview-question preparation (UC-AI-elicit-requirements); the critique and drafting assistants may use them as context.
- Supported formats are PDF (`.pdf`) and PowerPoint (`.pptx`, `.ppt`); the per-file size limit is system-configurable (default 25 MB).
- Honors FR-AI-source-material-context; the upload allowlist and text extraction are specified by SI-import-allowlist and SI-import-extraction.

### **UC-AI-elicit-requirements: The student elicits requirements with the elicitation assistant**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-elicit-requirements: Elicit requirements with the elicitation assistant
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Elicitation assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student indicates to start an elicitation session ("Help me elicit") with the elicitation assistant to prepare for or work through a discussion with the client.
**Description:** The student usually does not yet have the requirements — the knowledge lives with a client who is typically non-technical and is not present in the system. The student wants the elicitation assistant to coach her through eliciting requirements from that client: helping her formulate the right questions to ask, plan follow-up questions, and verify the client's answers (spotting vagueness, contradictions, and gaps that warrant another round). The assistant is deliberately Socratic — it coaches the student's own questioning and does not invent requirements or author content. Once the client's input is clarified and verified, the student returns to the system and drafts the content herself. This use case serves two scopes: a **broad, project-wide** session — typically the first one, run right after importing the client's pitch materials (UC-AI-import-source-material) with no authoring destination selected, to prepare for the first elicitation workshop — and a **focused, per-authoring-destination** session, run while eliciting for a particular authoring destination (a document section or a use case) so that the assistant has context for what she is trying to elicit. The two scopes differ only in what the assistant is grounded in; the coaching loop is the same.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team.
- PRE-3. The elicitation assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. An elicitation dialog (the assistant's coaching, and the questions and client answers the student worked through) is recorded for the session.
- POST-2. No requirement content is authored by the assistant; any requirements the student captures are drafted by her through the relevant authoring use cases.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student starts an elicitation session for a particular authoring destination — a document section or a use case.
2. The system gathers the authoring destination's content and template context, the imported project source material, and the course section's teaching context.
3. The system asks the elicitation assistant, via the LLM Service, to analyze the gaps between the authoring destination and its template and to propose client-interview questions for them, phrased in plain, non-technical language.
4. The system presents the assistant's suggested questions and follow-up strategies to the student.
5. The student conducts the discussion with the client outside the system and brings the client's answers back into the session.
6. The student shares the client's answers with the assistant; the assistant helps her verify them — flagging vague, ambiguous, or contradictory answers and proposing follow-up questions for the next round.
7. The student repeats the discuss-and-verify loop (returns to step 4) until the client's input is clear and complete enough to author.
8. Once the client's input is verified, the student returns to the system and drafts the content herself through UC-DOC-edit-document: Edit a section-based requirement document (or UC-DOC-edit-use-case: Edit a use case), optionally translating her verified notes into candidate requirements through UC-AI-structure-notes: Turn meeting notes into structured requirements.
9. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **1a. The student runs a broad, project-wide session (e.g., first-workshop prep after the pitch import)**
  - 1a1. The student starts the session without selecting an authoring destination.
  - 1a2. The system gathers the project's current requirements coverage across its documents and sections in place of a single authoring destination's context.
  - 1a3. The system asks the elicitation assistant, via the LLM Service, to perform a gap analysis comparing that coverage against what a complete set requires.
  - 1a4. The scenario continues from step 4.
- **1b. The imported pitch materials have gone stale and the student excludes them for the session**
  - 1b1. The system grounds the session only on the team's current drafted requirements, omitting the project source material from the assistant's context, and the scenario continues.
- **3a. The elicitation assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 3a1. The system informs the student that the elicitation assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **3b. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 3b1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and that the rest of RAM continues to operate, and terminates the use case.
- **4a. The student has already drafted a list of questions and wants them reviewed**
  - 4a1. The student submits her drafted questions; the assistant reviews them, flags technical jargon, and suggests plain-language phrasings suited to a non-technical client, each with a rationale. The student revises her questions herself, optionally accepting a suggested phrasing through UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal, then returns to step 4.
- **4b. The student wants to rehearse the interview before meeting the client**
  - 4b1. The student practices through UC-AI-practice-interview: Practice a client interview with a role-playing client assistant, then returns to step 5.
- **5a. The student can resolve the assistant's questions without a new client conversation**
  - 5a1. Using her existing knowledge and the imported project source material, the student answers the assistant's questions directly and proceeds to draft the content (step 8) — the common case for a focused, per-document-section "help me elicit" while authoring.
- **6a. The student asks the assistant to draft the requirements from the answers**
  - 6a1. Per the assistant's configured Socratic behavior, the system declines to author finished requirements and instead helps the student structure her own draft (optionally via UC-AI-structure-notes), returning to step 8.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** A broad, project-wide session typically once at the start, right after the pitch import, to prepare the first elicitation workshop; thereafter frequent, focused per-authoring-destination sessions throughout the elicitation-heavy phase, before and between client meetings.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-enablement, BR-assistant-socratic, BR-authored-prevails — The elicitation assistant shall be Socratic — it shall coach the student's questioning, follow-up, and verification rather than author requirements for her. The assistant must be enabled for the course section (UC-CFG-toggle-assistants). The system shall not author or modify student content with assistant-generated text without explicit confirmation. Real clients are not participants in the system. The project source material is a kickoff input that may become stale; where it conflicts with later authored-and-verified requirements, the authored content prevails, and the assistant shall not treat the imported pitch materials as authoritative over the team's current, verified requirements. The student may exclude the project source material from the assistant's grounding for a session, directing the assistant to rely only on the current drafted requirements.
**Associated Information:**
- Educational intent: the assistant trains the student to elicit from and communicate with a non-technical client and to verify client input — core skills this version teaches; productivity is deliberately subordinated to learning.
- Real clients are deliberately kept out of the system; the client discussion happens off-platform. The student can rehearse it against a simulated client through UC-AI-practice-interview.
- The assistant grounds its gap analysis in the imported project source material (UC-AI-import-source-material) when available and not excluded for the session, and draws on the teaching context configured for the course section (UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context).
- The imported pitch materials are a starting snapshot that rots as the project evolves; in the broad, project-wide mode the assistant grounds its gap analysis increasingly in the project's current requirements coverage, and flags when a gap or assumption rests only on the (possibly stale) pitch so the student knows to re-verify with the client. Later in the project the student can exclude the pitch entirely for a session and elicit against the drafted requirements alone.
- Reviewing the student's own draft questions — flagging technical jargon and suggesting plain-language phrasings with rationale — is part of this coaching, so the student learns to communicate with a non-technical client.
- All calls to the LLM Service are routed through the server-side AI proxy.
- Honors FR-AI-no-auto-edit, FR-AI-degradation, FR-AI-source-material-context.

### **UC-AI-practice-interview: The student practices a client interview with a role-playing client assistant**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-practice-interview: Practice a client interview with a role-playing client assistant
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Client Role-Play assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student indicates to start a practice client-interview session.
**Description:** The student wants to practice interviewing a non-technical client by conversing with an assistant that role-plays a client who gives vague, non-technical, and sometimes contradictory answers — so that the student practices extracting requirements from realistic, imperfect client input. This supports the educational goal of teaching client communication without putting a real client in the system.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team.
- PRE-3. The client role-play assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. A practice interview transcript is recorded for the session.
- POST-2. The session is a practice exercise on a fictional scenario; it produces no requirement content and contributes nothing to the team's real requirements.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to start a practice client-interview session, optionally selecting a scenario.
2. The system asks the client role-play assistant, via the LLM Service, to adopt the persona of a non-technical client for the selected scenario, using the teaching context for the scenario and grading standards.
3. The student asks the simulated client a question.
4. The client role-play assistant responds in character — in plain, non-technical language that may be vague or contradictory.
5. The student continues the interview (returns to step 3), probing and clarifying, and optionally records notes.
6. The student ends the session and reviews the recorded transcript and her notes to reflect on her interviewing technique.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **2a. The client role-play assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 2a1. The system informs the student that the assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **2b. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 2b1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and terminates the use case.

**Priority:** Low
**Frequency of Use:** Periodic; tied to client-communication exercises.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-enablement, BR-assistant-socratic — The client role-play assistant shall stay in the non-technical client persona and shall not author requirements for the student. The assistant must be enabled for the course section (UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).
**Associated Information:**
- Educational goal: train client communication without putting real clients in the system.
- The assistant draws on the teaching context for the scenario and the standards being taught.
- The practice runs on a fictional scenario: nothing the simulated client says is real project input, and the session yields no requirement content for the team's project. Its value is the interviewing skill the student builds before the real elicitation (UC-AI-elicit-requirements) — it is deliberately not wired to the structuring use case (UC-AI-structure-notes), which is for real client-meeting notes.
- Honors FR-AI-degradation.

### **UC-AI-structure-notes: The student turns meeting notes into structured requirements**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-structure-notes: Turn meeting notes into structured requirements
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Structuring assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student indicates to turn plain-language meeting notes into structured requirements.
**Description:** The student wants an assistant to help translate her plain-language client-meeting notes into structured requirements (e.g., candidate use cases, business rules, or functional requirements) so that she learns the translation from informal client language to structured requirements. The assistant proposes candidates; the student inspects and accepts or rejects each, and remains the author. Because a single set of notes usually yields several kinds of requirement, the candidates target different authoring destinations — a document section of a section-based requirement document (either narrative text such as Background or Introduction, or a requirement-artifact list such as Risks, Objectives, or functional requirements), or a use case in the Use Cases document, which is an artifact in its own right and not a document section — and each accepted candidate is applied to its authoring destination.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the content.
- PRE-3. The structuring assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).
- PRE-4. The student has plain-language notes to translate.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. Candidate structured requirements are proposed; only those the student explicitly accepts become artifacts she authors.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student provides her plain-language meeting notes and indicates to translate them.
2. The system gathers relevant context (the authoring destination templates, related glossary terms, and the teaching context).
3. The system asks the structuring assistant, via the LLM Service, to propose candidate structured requirements from the notes — each identifying its authoring destination (a document section, or a use case in the Use Cases document) and the note it derives from.
4. The structuring assistant returns the candidate requirements, organized by their authoring destinations — document sections and use cases alike (a single set of notes typically spans several).
5. The student reviews and accepts or rejects each candidate through UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal.
6. For each accepted candidate, the system applies it to its authoring destination as a draft the student authors — which requires her to hold that authoring destination's lock (a document section via UC-DOC-edit-document, or a use case via UC-DOC-edit-use-case) — and she refines and completes it through UC-DOC-create-use-case: Create a use case or UC-ART-create-artifact: Create a requirement artifact.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **2a. The structuring assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 2a1. The system informs the student that the assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **3a. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 3a1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **4a. The notes contain nothing the assistant can structure (e.g., too sparse or off-topic)**
  - 4a1. The system tells the student that no candidates were produced and suggests adding detail or eliciting more from the client (UC-AI-elicit-requirements); the use case ends.
- **6a. A candidate's authoring destination is locked by another team member**
  - 6a1. A candidate whose authoring destination — a document section or a use case — is held locked by another member cannot be applied until the lock is released; it remains pending while the student applies the candidates whose authoring destinations she can lock.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Periodic; after a real client meeting.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-socratic, BR-explicit-acceptance — Candidate requirements shall be applied only through the explicit acceptance loop of UC-AI-review-proposal (no "accept all"). The assistant must be enabled for the course section (UC-CFG-toggle-assistants). Each candidate shall show the note it derives from as rationale. An accepted candidate shall be applied to its authoring destination — a document section (UC-DOC-edit-document) or a use case (UC-DOC-edit-use-case) — and is subject to that authoring destination's lock; a candidate whose authoring destination is locked by another team member shall not be applied until the lock is released.
**Associated Information:**
- Teaches the translation from informal client language to structured requirements.
- The meeting notes are the student's own notes from a real client interaction (typically the off-platform interview she prepared for via UC-AI-elicit-requirements) — transient input provided for this session, not project source material (UC-AI-import-source-material) and not stored or graded as requirement content. Practice-interview notes (UC-AI-practice-interview) are fictional and are deliberately not used here.
- This use case **structures** verified notes into candidate requirements; it is distinct from the **verification** the elicitation assistant performs in UC-AI-elicit-requirements (step 6), which checks the client's raw answers for clarity, consistency, and completeness. The normal order is verify first (UC-AI-elicit-requirements), then structure the verified notes here.
- Each accepted candidate is applied through UC-AI-review-proposal as the student's own authored edit (recorded as hers, with provenance), then refined by her — the assistant never silently writes content.
- Honors FR-AI-rationale, FR-AI-no-auto-edit, FR-AI-degradation; per-item acceptance via UC-AI-review-proposal (BR-explicit-acceptance).

**Related Use Cases:** UC-AI-elicit-requirements: Elicit requirements with the elicitation assistant; UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal; UC-DOC-edit-document: Edit a section-based requirement document; UC-DOC-create-use-case: Create a use case; UC-DOC-edit-use-case: Edit a use case; UC-ART-create-artifact: Create a requirement artifact; UC-CFG-toggle-assistants: Enable or disable AI assistants for a course section.

### **UC-AI-critique: The student requests a critique from the critique assistant**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-critique: Request a critique from the critique assistant
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Critique assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student indicates to request an assistant critique of the currently selected document section or use case.
**Description:** The student wants the critique assistant to evaluate an authored document section or use case for clarity, ambiguity, consistency, completeness, and testability, and to explain why each issue weakens the requirements — so that the student can improve it herself. The critique is qualitative, rationale-rich feedback that complements, and is distinct from, the deterministic ReqLint validation in UC-VAL-run-validation. The assistant's rationale is itself the lesson.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the requirement document.
- PRE-3. The critique assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).
- PRE-4. A document section or a use case is selected and has authored content.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. A critique (findings with rationale) is generated and displayed, visually distinguished from student-authored content.
- POST-2. No content is modified by the assistant.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to request a critique of the selected item (a document section or a use case).
2. The system gathers the selected item's content and relevant context (its type, template guidance, related glossary terms, and the teaching context).
3. The system asks the critique assistant, via the LLM Service, to evaluate the selected item.
4. The critique assistant returns findings, each with a category (e.g., clarity, ambiguity, consistency, completeness, testability) and an instructive rationale explaining why it weakens the requirement.
5. The system presents the findings to the student, visually distinguished from authored content, each linked to the relevant location in the document section or use case.
6. The student reviews a finding, navigates to the location, and revises the document section or use case herself through UC-DOC-edit-document: Edit a section-based requirement document (or UC-DOC-edit-use-case: Edit a use case).
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **3a. The critique assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 3a1. The system informs the student that the critique assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **3b. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 3b1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **4a. The critique assistant proposes a concrete rewrite for a finding**
  - 4a1. The student reviews and accepts or rejects the proposed rewrite through UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Frequent; typically after drafting and before submission.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-socratic, BR-explicit-acceptance — Every critique finding shall include an instructive rationale. The critique assistant must be enabled for the course section (UC-CFG-toggle-assistants). The assistant shall not modify student-authored content without explicit confirmation (UC-AI-review-proposal). Critique is advisory and distinct from ReqLint validation (UC-VAL-run-validation).
**Associated Information:**
- Critique evaluates against the standards encoded in the teaching context (e.g., INVEST, testability, Wiegers categories).
- Distinct from UC-VAL-run-validation (ReqLint): ReqLint is deterministic rule-checking; critique is qualitative assistant feedback that complements it.
- Requesting a critique is read-only — it neither locks nor modifies the selected item. Acting on a finding changes content only through the normal path: a manual revision (UC-DOC-edit-document / UC-DOC-edit-use-case) or an accepted rewrite (extension 4a) via UC-AI-review-proposal, each subject to the selected item's lock.
- Honors FR-AI-rationale, FR-AI-no-auto-edit, FR-AI-distinguish-suggestions, FR-AI-degradation.

**Related Use Cases:** UC-VAL-run-validation: Run validation (ReqLint) on the current document; UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal; UC-DOC-edit-document: Edit a section-based requirement document; UC-DOC-edit-use-case: Edit a use case; UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context: Configure the teaching context for a course section; UC-CFG-toggle-assistants: Enable or disable AI assistants for a course section.

### **UC-AI-tutor: The student asks an assistant to explain a concept (Tutor Mode)**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-tutor: Ask an assistant to explain a concept (Tutor Mode)
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Tutor assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student indicates to ask the tutor assistant to explain a concept, a glossary term, or a flagged issue.
**Description:** The student wants the tutor assistant to explain a requirements-engineering concept, a glossary term, or a flagged issue (a ReqLint validation finding or a critique finding) — including, for a flagged issue, the rule that was violated and a suggested fix — so that she learns while authoring. Tutor Mode is purely educational; it does not modify content.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team.
- PRE-3. The tutor assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. An explanation is generated and displayed; no content is modified.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student selects what to explain — a concept, a glossary term, or a flagged ReqLint/critique issue — and asks the tutor assistant for an explanation.
2. The system gathers the relevant context (the selected item, related glossary terms, and the teaching context; for a flagged issue, the rule involved).
3. The system asks the tutor assistant, via the LLM Service, for an explanation.
4. The tutor assistant returns an instructive explanation; for a flagged issue, it describes the rule that was violated and a suggested fix.
5. The system displays the explanation in the AI panel.
6. The student optionally asks a follow-up question (returns to step 3).
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **3a. The tutor assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 3a1. The system informs the student that the tutor assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **3b. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 3b1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and terminates the use case.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Frequent; on demand while authoring or reviewing validation results.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-socratic — Tutor Mode shall not modify student-authored content. The tutor assistant must be enabled for the course section (UC-CFG-toggle-assistants). For a flagged validation issue, the explanation shall identify the rule violated and a suggested fix.
**Associated Information:**
- The tutor draws on the teaching context so explanations match the standards the student is graded against.
- Honors FR-AI-degradation.

**Related Use Cases:** UC-VAL-run-validation: Run validation (ReqLint) on the current document; UC-GLO-view-term: View a glossary term; UC-AI-critique: Request a critique from the critique assistant; UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context: Configure the teaching context for a course section; UC-CFG-toggle-assistants: Enable or disable AI assistants for a course section.

### **UC-AI-draft-skeleton: The student generates a draft requirement skeleton with an assistant**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-draft-skeleton: Generate a draft requirement skeleton with an assistant
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Drafting assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student indicates to generate a draft skeleton for a use case or a set of requirements from a short prompt.
**Description:** The student wants the drafting assistant to produce a draft structural skeleton — for example, an empty use-case template with candidate step placeholders, or a set of candidate functional-requirement stubs — that gives her a starting structure to refine. Because handing students polished requirements undercuts the educational goal, this assistant is disabled by default for a course section and produces scaffolding and clearly-marked candidates rather than finished content; it is intended primarily for the secondary, future real-developer audience, for whom it can be enabled.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the content.
- PRE-3. The drafting assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants). It is disabled by default in course use.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. A draft skeleton is proposed; nothing is added to the student's content except through explicit acceptance.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to generate a draft skeleton and provides a short prompt or selects the authoring destination (e.g., a new use case, or requirements for a feature).
2. The system gathers relevant context (the authoring destination template, related glossary terms, and the teaching context).
3. The system asks the drafting assistant, via the LLM Service, to produce a structural skeleton with candidate placeholders.
4. The drafting assistant returns the proposed skeleton.
5. The student reviews and accepts or rejects the proposal through UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal.
6. The accepted skeleton is applied as a draft on acceptance in step 5; the student then refines and completes it herself, authoring it out through UC-DOC-create-use-case: Create a use case (or UC-DOC-edit-use-case / UC-ART-create-artifact).
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **3a. The drafting assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 3a1. The system informs the student that the drafting assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **3b. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 3b1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and terminates the use case.

**Priority:** Low
**Frequency of Use:** Occasional; primarily in real-developer use rather than course use.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-enablement, BR-assistant-socratic, BR-explicit-acceptance — The drafting assistant shall be disabled by default for a course section and is enabled only through UC-CFG-toggle-assistants. Proposed content shall be applied only through the explicit acceptance loop of UC-AI-review-proposal (no "accept all"). The assistant shall produce scaffolding and clearly-marked candidates, not silently inserted finished content.
**Associated Information:**
- Educational tiebreaker: in course use this assistant is off by default so that students structure their own work; it exists chiefly for the secondary, future real-developer audience.
- Honors FR-AI-no-auto-edit, FR-AI-distinguish-suggestions, FR-AI-enablement, FR-AI-degradation; per-item acceptance via UC-AI-review-proposal (BR-explicit-acceptance); governed by UC-CFG-toggle-assistants.

**Related Use Cases:** UC-DOC-create-use-case: Create a use case; UC-ART-create-artifact: Create a requirement artifact; UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal; UC-CFG-toggle-assistants: Enable or disable AI assistants for a course section.

### **UC-AI-review-proposal: The student reviews and accepts or rejects an assistant proposal**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** The proposing assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** An assistant has produced a concrete proposal (a draft, rewrite, or set of candidate artifacts) and the student indicates to review it.
**Description:** Whenever an assistant proposes concrete content — a skeleton (UC-AI-draft-skeleton), a rewrite (UC-AI-critique), or structured requirements from notes (UC-AI-structure-notes) — the student must inspect the proposal against its rationale and consciously accept or reject it before any change is made to her content. This propose → inspect → accept loop is a deliberate teaching instrument: it forces the student to read the diff, understand the rationale, and make a decision. There is intentionally no "accept all" shortcut. This use case captures that shared loop; the proposing use cases invoke it.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the content.
- PRE-3. An assistant has produced a proposal for review.

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. Each proposed change is either accepted (and applied to its authoring destination as the student's authored content) or rejected (and discarded); no proposed change is applied without an explicit per-item acceptance.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The system presents the assistant's proposal as a set of discrete proposed changes — each targeting an authoring destination (a document section or a use case) — accompanied by the assistant's rationale and shown against that authoring destination's current content, visually distinguished from student-authored content.
2. The student inspects a proposed change and its rationale.
3. The student explicitly accepts or rejects that change.
4. On acceptance, the system applies the change to its authoring destination as authored content (recorded as the student's edit), which requires the student to hold that authoring destination's lock (a document section via UC-DOC-edit-document, or a use case via UC-DOC-edit-use-case). On rejection, the system discards the change.
5. The student repeats steps 2–4 for each proposed change.
6. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **1a. The student dismisses the entire proposal**
  - 1a1. The system discards all proposed changes; no content is modified; the use case ends.
- **2a. The student requests an explanation of a proposed change**
  - 2a1. The student asks the tutor assistant to explain through UC-AI-tutor: Ask an assistant to explain a concept, then returns to step 2.
- **4a. A change's authoring destination is locked by another team member**
  - 4a1. The system cannot apply that change until the lock is released; it remains pending while the student accepts, rejects, and applies the changes whose authoring destinations she can lock.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Whenever a generative assistant produces a proposal.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-socratic, BR-explicit-acceptance — The system shall not apply assistant-generated content without an explicit, per-item acceptance by the student. The system shall not provide an "accept all" shortcut. Each proposed change shall be shown with its rationale and visually distinguished until accepted. A change shall be applied only to its authoring destination — a document section (UC-DOC-edit-document) or a use case (UC-DOC-edit-use-case) — and only while the student holds that authoring destination's lock.
**Associated Information:**
- The friction in this loop is pedagogically intentional and shall not be optimized away.
- Specifies the per-item acceptance rule of BR-explicit-acceptance (no "accept all"); honors FR-AI-no-auto-edit, FR-AI-distinguish-suggestions.

### **UC-AI-consult-project-assistant: The student consults the project assistant**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-consult-project-assistant: Consult the project assistant
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Project assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student opens the project assistant in the project workspace and asks for help (for example, "Where should I start?", "What's missing?", or "Help me elicit").
**Description:** In the project workspace the student wants a single conversational entry point that helps her orient herself, understand where the team's requirements stand, find the right document or artifact, and reach the right specialized assistant for the task at hand. The project assistant is a router: it answers questions about project status and coverage, points the student to the relevant document section or use case, and routes her into the specialized assistants — for example launching a broad, project-wide elicitation session through UC-AI-elicit-requirements, a per-destination critique through UC-AI-critique, or a whole-project review through UC-AI-whole-project-review. Like every assistant it is deliberately Socratic and educational: it orients, explains, and routes, but never authors requirement content for her; authoring stays with the student through the normal use cases.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team.
- PRE-3. The project assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. The assistant conversation is recorded for the session.
- POST-2. No requirement content is authored by the assistant; any work the student does happens through the authoring or assistant use cases the assistant routes her to.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student opens the project assistant in the project workspace and asks a question about her project.
2. The system gathers the project's current requirements coverage across its documents and sections, the imported project source material, and the course section's teaching context.
3. The system asks the project assistant, via the LLM Service, to interpret the request and respond — answering about status or coverage, pointing to the relevant document or artifact, or recommending the specialized assistant or action that fits.
4. The system presents the assistant's response and any recommended next actions to the student.
5. The student follows a recommended action, and the system routes her into the corresponding use case (for example, UC-AI-elicit-requirements for elicitation or UC-AI-critique for a critique).
6. The student continues the conversation (returns to step 1) or proceeds in the use case she was routed to.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **3a. The project assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 3a1. The system informs the student that the assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **3b. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 3b1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and that the rest of RAM continues to operate, and terminates the use case.
- **4a. The student asks the assistant to author or change requirement content**
  - 4a1. Per its Socratic configuration, the system declines to author content and instead routes the student to the appropriate authoring use case (for example, UC-DOC-edit-document or UC-DOC-edit-use-case) or specialized assistant.
- **5a. The recommended assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 5a1. The system tells the student the recommended assistant is unavailable and suggests an available alternative or action.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Frequent; a common entry point into the project workspace throughout the project.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-enablement, BR-assistant-socratic — The project assistant shall be Socratic — it shall orient, explain, and route rather than author requirement content. The assistant must be enabled for the course section (UC-CFG-toggle-assistants). The system shall not author or modify student content with assistant-generated text without explicit confirmation. When routing the student into a specialized assistant, the system shall honor that assistant's own enablement and rules for the course section.
**Associated Information:**
- The assistant is a router over the specialized assistants; it invokes their use cases rather than duplicating their behavior — for example, broad, project-wide elicitation runs through UC-AI-elicit-requirements.
- It draws on the project's current requirements coverage, the imported project source material, and the teaching context configured for the course section (UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context).
- Educational intent: it lowers the cost of finding the right next step without doing the student's thinking for her; productivity is deliberately subordinate to learning.
- All calls to the LLM Service are routed through the server-side AI proxy.
- Honors FR-AI-no-auto-edit, FR-AI-enablement, FR-AI-degradation.

### **UC-AI-whole-project-review: The student requests a whole-project review from the critique assistant**

**UC ID and Name:** UC-AI-whole-project-review: Request a whole-project review from the critique assistant
**Created By:**
**Date Created:**
**Primary Actor:** student
**Secondary Actors:** Critique assistant (realized via the LLM Service)
**Trigger:** The student indicates to request a whole-project review of the team's requirement documents (via a "Review whole project" action, or routed in from the project assistant in UC-AI-consult-project-assistant).
**Description:** The student wants the critique assistant to review the team's entire set of requirement documents together — not one selected document section or use case — so that she can find cross-document problems that are invisible when reviewing one item at a time: coverage gaps, inconsistencies, conflicts, and broken traceability across the documents. The review is qualitative, rationale-rich feedback that complements both the deterministic ReqLint validation (UC-VAL-run-validation) and the per-destination critique (UC-AI-critique). It is governed by the cross-document review criteria the instructor configures for the course section (UC-CFG-configure-review-criteria); the assistant's rationale is itself the lesson.

**Preconditions:**
- PRE-1. The student is logged into the system.
- PRE-2. The student is a member of the team that owns the documents.
- PRE-3. The critique assistant is enabled for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-toggle-assistants).
- PRE-4. The cross-document review criteria are defined for the student's course section (see UC-CFG-configure-review-criteria).

**Postconditions:**
- POST-1. A whole-project review (cross-document findings with rationale) is generated and displayed, visually distinguished from student-authored content.
- POST-2. No content is modified by the assistant.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. The student indicates to request a whole-project review of the team's requirement documents.
2. The system gathers the content of all the team's requirement documents, the relevant requirements-graph context for traceability, the course section's cross-document review criteria (UC-CFG-configure-review-criteria), and the teaching context (UC-CFG-configure-teaching-context).
3. The system asks the critique assistant, via the LLM Service, to evaluate the documents together against the configured criteria.
4. The critique assistant returns cross-document findings, each with a category (e.g., completeness, coverage and traceability, consistency, conflict), a location or set of locations, and an instructive rationale explaining why it weakens the requirements.
5. The system presents the findings to the student, visually distinguished from authored content, each linked to the relevant document, document section, or use case.
6. The student reviews a finding, navigates to the location, and revises the document section or use case herself through UC-DOC-edit-document: Edit a section-based requirement document (or UC-DOC-edit-use-case: Edit a use case).
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**
- **1a. The cross-document review criteria are not defined for the course section**
  - 1a1. The system informs the student that the whole-project review is unavailable until her instructor defines the criteria (UC-CFG-configure-review-criteria) and terminates the use case.
- **3a. The critique assistant is disabled for the course section**
  - 3a1. The system informs the student that the critique assistant is unavailable and terminates the use case.
- **3b. The LLM Service is unavailable or times out**
  - 3b1. The system informs the student that AI assistance is temporarily unavailable and that the rest of RAM continues to operate, and terminates the use case.
- **4a. The critique assistant proposes a concrete rewrite for a finding**
  - 4a1. The student reviews and accepts or rejects the proposed rewrite through UC-AI-review-proposal: Review and accept or reject an assistant proposal.

**Priority:** High
**Frequency of Use:** Periodic; typically at milestones and before submission.
**Business Rules:** BR-assistant-socratic, BR-explicit-acceptance — Every finding shall include an instructive rationale. The critique assistant must be enabled for the course section (UC-CFG-toggle-assistants). The assistant shall not modify student-authored content without explicit confirmation (UC-AI-review-proposal). The review is advisory and distinct from ReqLint validation (UC-VAL-run-validation).
**Associated Information:**
- The whole-project review reads the team's entire set of requirement documents together (the document set may grow beyond the current five); it is the project-wide complement to the per-destination critique in UC-AI-critique and to the elicitation assistant's broad-mode gap analysis (UC-AI-elicit-requirements, extension 1a).
- The dimensions and standards applied are the cross-document review criteria configured by the instructor for the course section (UC-CFG-configure-review-criteria); the review methodology and the system-provided default criteria set are maintained in `docs/product/cross-document-review-criteria.md`.
- Requesting a whole-project review is read-only — it neither locks nor modifies any document. Acting on a finding changes content only through the normal path: a manual revision (UC-DOC-edit-document / UC-DOC-edit-use-case) or an accepted rewrite (extension 4a) via UC-AI-review-proposal, each subject to the affected item's lock.
- Reachable directly (a "Review whole project" action) and via the project assistant (UC-AI-consult-project-assistant), which routes the student into this use case.
- Honors FR-AI-rationale, FR-AI-no-auto-edit, FR-AI-degradation.
